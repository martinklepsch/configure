  Hey! I built this little tool to be able to easily install my dotfiles
  on different machines and servers.

  It's probably useful for you too.
%form#github_info{:action => "/setup_username", :method => "post", :name => "setup_form"}
  %input#github_clone_url{:name => "github_clone_url", :placeholder => "git@github.com:you/dotfiles.git", :type => "text", :size => "30"}
    %button{:type => "submit"}
      Sounds fun!
